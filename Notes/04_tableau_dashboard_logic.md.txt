# Tableau Dashboard Logic

Tableau Public was used to create interactive dashboards.

Key visuals included:
- Ride volume over time
- Booking status distribution
- Revenue by payment method
- Vehicle type and customer performance analysis

Tableau was used purely for visualization, not for data transformation.
