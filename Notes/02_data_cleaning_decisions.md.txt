# Data Cleaning & Transformation Decisions

Key decisions made during data cleaning:

- Rows with invalid booking IDs were removed
- Ratings were retained only for successful rides
- Date fields were standardized to a single format
- Numerical fields were rounded to one decimal place
- Cancellation reasons were kept only for cancelled rides

These rules ensured data consistency and business accuracy.
