# SQL Server Design & Query Logic

- Cleaned data was imported into SQL Server using appropriate data types
- Primary keys were defined where applicable
- SQL queries were optimized using aggregations and filters
- Business KPIs such as revenue, ride count, and cancellation metrics were computed at the database level

SQL Server acted as the single source of truth for analysis.
